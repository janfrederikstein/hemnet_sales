# hemnet_sales

The goals of this project are multi-fold:
1. Learn more about web-scraping
2. Learn more about supervised classification models for continuous price predictions on real-world data
3. Learn more about apartment prices in Stockholm

The data collection was done by scraping information about apartments that were sold in Stockholm Kommun from the popular listing site www.hemnet.se 

- **For the web-scraper, please see hemnet_scraper.ipynb**

- **EDA and subsequent model development will be in hemnet_data.ipynb**
